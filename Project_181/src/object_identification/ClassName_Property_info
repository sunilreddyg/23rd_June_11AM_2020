			ID
			Name
			ClassName
			Tagname
			Linktext
			PartialLinktext

			CssSelector


			=> To Copty CssSelector  and Xpath we have plugin called [Chropath]
			=> To Copy relative xpath we have plugin called  [Truepath]


			Que:--> What if we don't have plugins.

Identification with classname:--->

		1.<div  class="Sbtn"  type="submit"></div>
		2.<div  class="Sbtn"  role="list"></div>

		=> Here webdriver identify first object because class property is
		   duplicated, When any property duplicated webdriver give priority to first object.

		driver.findElement(By.className("Sbtn")).click();    


		Que:--> How to check duplication of any property.
		Ans:-->  
			1. Open Webpage
			2. Open HtmlSource
			3. Copy propertyvalue to search
			4. Press Cntrl+F
			5. Type Property value and Press Enter
			6. Then Selector display how many times the object is duplicated at HtmlSource.

		Que:--> Identification with className propeprty when Class Property Have Spaces.

			HtmlSource:-->
				<input  class="TextBox Username" ></input>

				driver.findElement(By.ClassName("TextBox Username"));
				=> for the above identification webdriver throw Exception [WebDriver Exception]
				   Because we can't define class property along with spaces.
				=> In HtmlSource during class property space is indication for separate property.

		
				Solution:-->
					Define before or after space any single class property.
	
					driver.FindElement(By.ClassName("TextBox"));
							[OR]
					driver.findElement(By.ClassName("Username"));

			
				Note:--> We can use Class property along with spaces, During
					xpath or cssSelector identifications.
